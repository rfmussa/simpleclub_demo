This energy is then used in the second step, water splitting, where water molecules are broken down into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen ions and electrons from this process are used to produce ATP and NADPH. In the final step, carbon fixation, the plant uses the energy from ATP and NADPH to convert carbon dioxide from the air into glucose through a series of chemical reactions known as the Calvin cycle. This glucose can then be used by the plant for growth and energy storage.",
